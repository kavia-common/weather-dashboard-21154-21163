# Copy this file to .env and set your OpenWeather API key.
# Only use this single variable. Do NOT create double-prefixed variants.
REACT_APP_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key_here

# Notes:
# - React only exposes vars prefixed with REACT_APP_ at build time.
# - After changing .env, you must restart the dev server (npm start) for changes to take effect.
# - The app uses HTTPS OpenWeather endpoints to avoid mixed-content/CORS issues.
